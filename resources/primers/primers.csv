Step,Item,Item Code,Supplier,Approx. Cost*,Approx. Samples Per Unit,Number for ~400 samples**,Notes
DNA Extraction,Qiagen DNA Investigator Kit [50],56504,Qiagen, € 314.00 ,50,10,"We have only really explored Qiagen extraction.  Chelex yields more DNA, but tends to be of lower quality.  Probably any Qiagen extraction is fine."
DNA QC,Qubit™ 1X dsDNA High Sensitivity (HS) [500],Q33231,Invitrogen, € 366.00 ,500,1,"Samples very approximate, when we are piloting we usually do >1 reading per sample during preparation. Once things are established, we don't read every sample all the time."
Agarose Gel QC,1kbp Ladder,SM0313,ThermoFisher, € 64.75 ,,1,"Some teams don't have a 1kbp ladder, our amplicons are 3-4kbp  so this is helpful."
sWGA,sWGA Primer Mix,-,IDT, € 87.70 ,,1,
sWGA,phi29 DNA polymerase,M0269L,NEB, € 200.46 ,125,5,
sWGA,NEB Dexoynucleotide (dNTP) solution mix,N0447L,NEB, € 211.38 ,800,2,
PCR,KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit (1.25mL),KK2601,Roche, € 105.80 ,100,5,KAPA is the high fidelity polymerase we are using for the multiplex PCR. We are switching from the KK2101 to KK2601 kit; the later is a premix which minimises pipetting. We are pretty sure it works equivalently.
PCR,NOMADS8/16 Multiplex Primers,-,IDT, € 74.60 ,,1,
Sample Barcoding,NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Kit with purification beads 96,E7103L,NEB," € 2,419.00 ",480,1,"This contains everything for the sample barcoding preparation and ligation reaction, plus a backup polymerase."
Adapter Ligation,NEBNext Quick Ligation Module,E6056L,NEB," € 1,328.00 ",9600,1,"You can probably get the smaller kit size, this does almost 10k samples."
Library Prep & Sequencing,"MinION Enhanced Starter Pack, including:",-,ONT," € 3,106.00 ",400,1,"This includes a MinION, four R10.4.1 flow cells, a sequecing kit of your choice, and a wash kit. I think would be nice to get the rapid kit here, since you can buy the ligation kit separate and the rapid kit is helpful for quick sequencing / trouble shooting."
,R10.4.1 Flow Cell [4],FLO-MIN114,ONT, € -   ,,,
,Rapid Barcoding Kit 24 V14,SQK-RBK114.24,ONT, € -   ,,,
Library Prep & Sequencing,Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14,SQK-NBD114.96,ONT, € 760.00 ,400,1,This includes the barcodes needed for running multiple samples on a flow cell.
Library Prep & Sequencing,Flow Cell Wash Kit,EXP-WSH004,ONT, € 95.00 ,,2,"These are really cheap, and you can use them to wash the flow cells a few times to get more out of them."
